<h2> THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED! </h2>
<p>An unofficial <b>W.I.P.</b> port of the Cyclic mod for Fabric with block and texture redesigns</p>
Currently focusing on implementing blocks before doing items.

I plan on porting this over to **1.19.2** and **1.18.2**, a 1.16.5 port is unlikely for now.
This will happen once 1.20.1 is completed/nearly finished.
